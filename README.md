# An Introduction To Development With Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. This session will introduce you to Azure Functions, show you how to build and deploy functions that act as web services or timer jobs, and show you how to secure your functions using Entra ID (Azure Active Directory). Familiarity with Entra ID app registration and authentication will be beneficial for attendees of this session.
